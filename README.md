# google-drive-mcp

> Surgical Google Docs editing for AI agents — preserves history, never touches character indices.

An MCP server that makes Google Docs actually usable for LLMs. **Standalone** — no other tools required beyond a Google Cloud OAuth app.

## Why

The Google Docs API uses **character indices** for every edit. LLMs are bad at counting characters. Everyone ends up deleting and rewriting entire documents, which destroys version history, comments, and collaborator attribution.

This server uses the same abstraction as code editors: **search by text, not by position**. You describe *what* to change; the server finds *where* it is and handles the index arithmetic.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Run directly from GitHub

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp google-drive-mcp --help
```

That command downloads the package, creates an isolated environment, installs dependencies, and runs the `google-drive-mcp` entry point.

No PyPI release is required. `uvx` can execute the tool straight from the GitHub repository.

To pin to a branch, tag, or commit, add a ref to the URL:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp@main google-drive-mcp --help
```

If you prefer a persistent local install instead of `uvx`, use:

```bash
uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp google-drive-mcp
uv tool install --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp google-drive-mcp-auth
```

### 2. Create a Google Cloud OAuth app

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project (or select an existing one)
3. Enable these APIs (**APIs & Services → Library**):
   - **Google Docs API**
   - **Google Drive API**
   - **Google Apps Script API** *(for inline-anchored comments)*
4. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**
5. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
6. Application type: **Desktop App**
7. Download the JSON file

### 3. Authenticate

**Normal — browser opens automatically:**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp \
  google-drive-mcp-auth --credentials ~/credentials.json
```

**Or use env vars instead of a credentials file:**
```bash
export GOOGLE_DRIVE_MCP_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
export GOOGLE_DRIVE_MCP_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp \
  google-drive-mcp-auth
```

**Headless / remote server — no browser on device:**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp \
  google-drive-mcp-auth --credentials ~/credentials.json --headless
# Prints a URL → open on any device (phone, laptop, etc.)
# Paste the full redirect URL back into the terminal
```

**Already have an auth code:**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp \
  google-drive-mcp-auth --credentials ~/credentials.json --code "4/0Afr..."
```

`google-drive-mcp-auth` resolves OAuth client credentials in this order:

1. `--credentials /path/to/credentials.json`
2. `--client-id` and `--client-secret`
3. `GOOGLE_DRIVE_MCP_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_DRIVE_MCP_CLIENT_SECRET`

Token is saved to `~/.google-drive-mcp/token.json` by default. Override with `--out /path/to/token.json`.

### 4. Configure your MCP client

**Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-drive": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp", "google-drive-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_DRIVE_MCP_TOKEN": "/Users/you/.google-drive-mcp/token.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**OpenClaw** (gateway config):
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "google-drive": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/dbuxton/google-drive-mcp", "google-drive-mcp"],
        "env": {
          "GOOGLE_DRIVE_MCP_TOKEN": "~/.google-drive-mcp/token.json"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Local checkout during development:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-drive": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "/absolute/path/to/google-drive-mcp", "google-drive-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_DRIVE_MCP_TOKEN": "/Users/you/.google-drive-mcp/token.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools reference

### Document reading

#### `docs_get(doc_id)`
Read a Google Doc and return its full structure.

Returns the document title, a list of paragraphs (with text, heading style, and character indices), and the full plain text. Use this first to understand the document before making edits.

```
docs_get(doc_id="1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgVE2upms")
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "title": "My Document",
  "paragraphs": [
    {"text": "Introduction", "style": "HEADING_1", "start": 0, "end": 13},
    {"text": "This is the body.", "style": "NORMAL_TEXT", "start": 13, "end": 31}
  ],
  "full_text": "Introduction\nThis is the body."
}
```

---

#### `docs_list(query, limit)`
List Google Docs from Drive, optionally filtered by a search query.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | string | `""` | Search terms (searches title and content) |
| `limit` | int | `20` | Maximum results |

```
docs_list(query="board deck 2026", limit=5)
```

---

### Document editing

All editing tools use **text anchors**, never character indices. The server finds the text and handles the indices internally.

#### `docs_search_replace(doc_id, find, replace, occurrence, regex)`
Find text in a document and replace a specific occurrence.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `doc_id` | string | required | Google Doc ID |
| `find` | string | required | Text to find |
| `replace` | string | required | Replacement text |
| `occurrence` | int | `1` | Which occurrence: `1` = first, `2` = second, `0` = **all** |
| `regex` | bool | `false` | Treat `find` as a Python regex |

```
# Replace first occurrence
docs_search_replace(doc_id="...", find="Q1 2024", replace="Q2 2024")

# Replace all occurrences
docs_search_replace(doc_id="...", find="ACME Corp", replace="Initech", occurrence=0)

# Regex replace
docs_search_replace(doc_id="...", find=r"\bDraft\b", replace="Final", regex=true)
```

---

#### `docs_insert_after(doc_id, anchor, text)`
Insert a new paragraph immediately after the paragraph containing `anchor`.

```
docs_insert_after(
  doc_id="...",
  anchor="Executive Summary",
  text="Updated as of March 2026 following board review."
)
```

---

#### `docs_insert_before(doc_id, anchor, text)`
Insert a new paragraph immediately before the paragraph containing `anchor`.

```
docs_insert_before(
  doc_id="...",
  anchor="Appendix A",
  text="See the following appendix for supporting data."
)
```

---

#### `docs_delete_paragraph(doc_id, anchor)`
Delete all paragraphs containing `anchor` text (case-insensitive).

```
docs_delete_paragraph(doc_id="...", anchor="[PLACEHOLDER — DELETE ME]")
```

---

#### `docs_append(doc_id, text)`
Append a new paragraph at the end of the document.

```
docs_append(doc_id="...", text="Document last updated: March 2026.")
```

---

#### `docs_batch_replace(doc_id, replacements_json)`
Apply multiple find→replace operations **atomically** in a single API call. Either all changes succeed or none do.

```
docs_batch_replace(
  doc_id="...",
  replacements_json='[
    {"find": "[CLIENT]", "replace": "Acme Corp", "occurrence": 0},
    {"find": "[DATE]", "replace": "10 March 2026", "occurrence": 0},
    {"find": "DRAFT", "replace": "FINAL"}
  ]'
)
```

Each item in the array:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `find` | string | required | Text to find |
| `replace` | string | required | Replacement text |
| `occurrence` | int | `1` | `1` = first, `0` = all |
| `regex` | bool | `false` | Regex mode |

---

#### `docs_create(title, initial_text)`
Create a new Google Doc.

```
docs_create(title="Q2 Board Deck", initial_text="Confidential — not for distribution.")
```

Returns `{id, title, webViewLink}`.

---

### Comments

#### `docs_add_comment(doc_id, comment, anchor_text, occurrence)`
Add a comment anchored to specific text in the document.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `doc_id` | string | required | Google Doc ID |
| `comment` | string | required | Comment text |
| `anchor_text` | string | required | Text in the document to attach the comment to |
| `occurrence` | int | `1` | Which occurrence of `anchor_text` to use |

Use a short, distinctive phrase for `anchor_text` — a few words that are unique enough to match exactly one location.

```
docs_add_comment(
  doc_id="...",
  anchor_text="unable to perform the Employee's duties",
  comment="Legal risk: 3-month absence threshold may not satisfy Equality Act 2010 duty to make reasonable adjustments before terminating."
)
```

> **Note:** The current implementation uses Drive comments plus a Docs named range. In the Docs UI these still show as *"Original content deleted"* rather than as proper inline highlights. The comments are fully readable via `docs_read_comments` and the Docs 💬 panel.
>
> The next thing to try is Apps Script automation. For that path, auth must include the `script.*` scopes, the Google account must have the Apps Script API enabled at <https://script.google.com/home/usersettings>, **and** any script executed through `scripts.run` must use the same **standard Google Cloud project** as the OAuth client. A default Apps Script project is not enough for remote execution.
>
> A probe helper is included for this workstream:
>
> ```bash
> python3 appscript_probe.py inspect-comment-api --doc-id <DOC_ID>
> ```
>
> The probe now creates an API-executable deployment automatically. If account-level Apps Script access is still disabled, it stops with the settings-page message. If execution fails with a permission error, the next blocker is the shared standard Google Cloud project requirement documented at <https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects>.

---

#### `docs_read_comments(doc_id, include_resolved)`
List all comments on a document.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `doc_id` | string | required | Google Doc ID |
| `include_resolved` | bool | `false` | Include resolved/deleted comments |

Returns an array of comments with `id`, `content`, `author`, `anchored` (bool), `named_range_id`, `quoted_text`, `resolved`, `deleted`, `created`.

```
docs_read_comments(doc_id="...")
```

---

#### `docs_reply_to_comment(doc_id, comment_id, reply)`
Post a reply to an existing comment.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `doc_id` | string | required | Google Doc ID |
| `comment_id` | string | required | Comment ID (from `docs_read_comments`) |
